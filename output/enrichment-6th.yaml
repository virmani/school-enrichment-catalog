Each session will be an hour. The session will open up with a 5-10 minute ice-breaker activity, where students are required to draw still forms from their surroundings with dialogues or character expressions, this allows the class to know how their fellow students are doing and how to be supportive towards their peer group. This activity also sets pace for the main topic of the session, which lasts for 20-30 minutes. The main themes in this class range from understanding and drawing basic comic elements, to character design and personalities, character facial expressions, gestures, the use of emanata lines, sound effects, dialogues and thought bubbles, self-made flip books, basics of animation, to web publishing formats for comics online (The themes are appropriated to class age and size). The last 5-10 minutes of the class are for questions that students may have or an overall class critique on the work done by the students. The critiquing is always constructive, to make the students realize their own potential as artists and storytellers.
