    programOverview: 'Come clap your hands, stomp your feet, and shake your hips to the rhythm and the beat! In the JAMaROO Kids Music & Movement classes, we’ll sing traditional songs and learn original ones too (many written by our own teachers). Our music curriculum has been developed to spark creativity and incorporate imaginative play. Each month, we’ll focus on a different seasonal curriculum that incorporates the use of puppets, books, and other props to maximize the educational experience and keep classes fun and exciting! Throughout the year, our teachers will use a variety of simple instruments and introduce children to different genres of music from around the world. Through movement activities, children will build gross motor skills, directly encouraging strength, balance, and coordination. Our teachers will use bean bags, scarves, shakers, rhythm sticks, and other equipment to make classes more interactive and hands-on. At JAMaROO Kids all of our music, dance, and yoga curriculum is developed to support and foster all five key areas of development: Cognitive, Speech & Language, Gross Motor Development, Fine Motor Development, Social and Emotional.
